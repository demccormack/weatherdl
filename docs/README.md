# Weather Downloader
This script downloads all the images required for a weather briefing in Omarama, New Zealand, and builds a PPTX file pre-populated with those images.

## Quick Start

1. Find the [latest release](https://github.com/demccormack/weatherdl/releases/latest)
2. Download the correct file for your operating system
3. Unzip the file
4. Run the executable

## Prepare your briefing
The script has created a new directory on your desktop full of today's weather images as well as a PPTX file already populated with them. Open this file and hide/unhide the slides relevant to today's briefing. Add your own title, summary and goodbye slides and you are good to go!

### Missing images
You may need to re-run the script in order to download an image that wasn't available before. When you do this, a new PPTX file will be created. The original file is safe and your partially-prepared briefing won't be overwritten. However you will need to manually insert the missing image.
